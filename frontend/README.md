# ANPR Frontend - Final (Light Theme)

This is the final polished React frontend (Tailwind CSS) for the ANPR project.

## Setup

1. Inside the frontend folder:
   npm install
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   npm start

2. Make sure backend is running at http://localhost:8000

The UI shows only the cleaned plate number, highlights the detected plate with a bounding box, and provides a copy button.
